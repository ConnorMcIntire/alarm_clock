# Alarm

This Python project allows the user to set a timer, and when the timer finishes, an alarm sound will play. The user can specify the duration in minutes and seconds, and the program will count down to zero, showing the remaining time on the console. Once the timer reaches zero, an alarm sound (alarm.mp3) will play.

## Features

- Set the timer using minutes and seconds.
- Countdown display in `mm:ss` format.
- Play a sound (alarm.mp3) when the timer finishes.
- Clear the console every second to update the countdown.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `playsound` library to play the alarm sound.
